          Submitting additional case files to our team is very convenient with
          our file uploader. We do not accept .STL files through our file
          uploader and request that you use our digital protocols to send any
          digital impressions to our lab. Our drag & drop file uploader is an
          excellent tool to submit photos and other casework.
